## Introduction
Built and deployed an advance car simulation using sensors, collision detection, and fully automated driving using a neural network and Machine Learning. 

By building this application I explored and learned aspects such as:

- How to create a neural network using JavaScript with no libraries
- Make a self-driving car simulation
- Implement car driving mechanics
- Defining an environment
- Simulate sensors
- Detect collisions
- Make the car control itself using a neural network
- Visually display an active and working neural network with animations
